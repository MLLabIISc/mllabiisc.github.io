The Machine Learning Lab of the Department of Computer Science and Automation at the Indian Institute of Science was setup to study theoretical and applied aspects of machine learning in various domains. Our aim is to explore and understand artificial intelligence, including machine learning, deep learning, numerical optimization, and natural language processing and to perform research on their applicability in various domains.

To this end, we develop numerous machine learning algorithms and tools for complex real world applications. We want to be able to build AI enabled systems that solve problems for social good. We are actively pursuing applications in the area of computational biology, object detection in images, video segmentation and summarization, detection of rare topics in text documents, statistical modeling of computer systems.

We are located in Bangalore which is the silicon valley of India. We are also collaborating with industries as well as other universities for cutting edge research.
